# Phase 2: Walkthrough

## Current state

- Done: Task 1 (Montserrat font).
- Next: Task 2 (droidcon colours), then 3 and 4, which don't depend on each other.
- Open: the unused Google Sans TTFs (about 4 MB) are still in `shared/resources/.../font/`; delete them in a cleanup if wanted.
- Known issues: none. Mobile is not a priority; verify on desktop and wasm only.

## How to verify

- Task 1: `./gradlew :shared:design:compileKotlinJvm` passes; `git diff 9832e28 -- shared/design/src/commonMain/kotlin/ke/don/design/theme/Type.kt` touches only font families; slide text renders in Montserrat on `./gradlew :desktopApp:run` (not yet checked visually).

## Changes by task

### Task 1: Montserrat font
- Added `montserrat_variable.ttf` and `OFL.txt` to `shared/resources/src/commonMain/composeResources/font/`.
- `Resources.Font`: added `MONTSERRAT`; removed `GOOGLE_SANS_EXTRA_LIGHT` and `GOOGLE_SANS_BOLD` (unreferenced), which removes the bug. `ROBOTO_MONO_EXTRA_LIGHT` kept.
- `Type.kt`: `montserratFontFamily` (Thin to ExtraBold via `FontVariation.weight`) backs the body, display and subheadings families; the type ramp is unchanged. Code uses `FontFamily.Monospace`.
- Reviewer NOTE: the Google Sans TTFs are now unreferenced; desktop rendering was not checked.

## Deviations from spec

None.
