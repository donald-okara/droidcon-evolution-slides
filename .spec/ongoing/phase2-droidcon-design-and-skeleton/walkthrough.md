# Phase 2: Walkthrough

## Current state

- Done: Task 1 (Montserrat font), Task 2 (droidcon colours).
- Next: Task 3 (logo SVGs), then Task 4 (cube model port).
- Open with the user: code snippets use `FontFamily.Monospace`, not Roboto Mono; fixing it means editing `:shared:components` (NF2).
- Open: the unused Google Sans TTFs (about 4 MB) are still in `shared/resources/.../font/`; delete them in a cleanup if wanted.
- Known issues: none. Mobile is not a priority; verify on desktop and wasm only.

## How to verify

- Task 1: `./gradlew :shared:design:compileKotlinJvm` passes; `git diff 9832e28 -- shared/design/src/commonMain/kotlin/ke/don/design/theme/Type.kt` touches only font families; slide text renders in Montserrat on `./gradlew :desktopApp:run` (not yet checked visually).
- Task 2: `./gradlew :shared:design:compileKotlinJvm` passes; `grep -n "6D538B" shared/design/src` returns nothing; deck shows blue/green/black in light and dark (not yet checked visually).

## Changes by task

### Task 1: Montserrat font
- Added `montserrat_variable.ttf` and `OFL.txt` to `shared/resources/src/commonMain/composeResources/font/`.
- `Resources.Font`: added `MONTSERRAT`; removed `GOOGLE_SANS_EXTRA_LIGHT` and `GOOGLE_SANS_BOLD` (unreferenced), which removes the bug. `ROBOTO_MONO_EXTRA_LIGHT` kept.
- `Type.kt`: `montserratFontFamily` (Thin to ExtraBold via `FontVariation.weight`) backs the body, display and subheadings families; the type ramp is unchanged. Code uses `FontFamily.Monospace`.
- Reviewer NOTE: the Google Sans TTFs are now unreferenced; desktop rendering was not checked.
### Task 2: Droidcon colours
- `Color.kt`: only the Chai base-scheme roles (§1.2) under the existing `*Light`/`*Dark` names; contrast variants and roles Chai doesn't set (surfaceDim, surfaceBright, scrim, errorContainer) removed so Material defaults apply.
- `Theme.kt`: schemes rebuilt from the Chai roles; `AppTheme` provides `LocalChaiColors`.
- `ChaiColors.kt` (new): `ChaiColors`, `lightChaiColors`/`darkChaiColors` (identical, as in the source), `LocalChaiColors`, `object CubeColors`, `object Pre2026Palette`.
- Reviewer NOTE: all values match design-inventory §1.2 to 1.4 and §4; visual check not done.

## Deviations from spec

None.
